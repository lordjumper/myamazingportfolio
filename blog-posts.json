            "content": "<p>When I first started programming in 2020 I was fascinated by all cool and amazing things I could do. Making a character move for the first time in Unity was exciting and every new thing provided me with a new dopamine hit each time. But then I reached a point where things began getting technical, hard, and frustrating and all that excitement had vanished.</p> <h2>Stuck in a Deadlock</h2> <p1>For the past 2-3 years I haven't been doing much of anything to be honest other then focusing on my studies, playing games, and going outside (yes I touch grass). I kept seeing people make many cool things online, things I could only ever dream of doing.</p1> <h2>Revival</h2> <p1>Seeing all these amazing projects gave me a burst of motivation but as all forms of motivation they don't last too long. So how did I keep developing and find the motivation to keep going? In many cases there is never truly a way to keep fueling it, you can keep looking at other people's work and try to get motivated that way but ultimately you need to discipline yourself and push through until you find yourself loving your work and willingly going back to work on it.</p2><blockquote>Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing. - John C.
